Intelligent Process Automation

Automation enabled by context-aware robots

 The best of two worlds

Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) refers to the application of Artificial Intelligence and related new technologies, including Computer Vision, Cognitive automation and Machine Learning to Robotic Process Automation. This convergence of technologies produces automation capabilities that dramatically elevate business value and competitive advantages for our customers. UiPath creates IPA solutions by using artificial intelligence (AI) to amplify the power of

our RPA technology in three ways. UiPath’s IPA is based on advanced computer vision, unattended robotics, and integration with third party cognitive services from Google, IBM, Microsoft and ABBYY. With a continuous release cycle, UiPath is committed to its AI/Cognitive journey and will be offering more Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning services on Cloud and on-premise in upcoming releases.

 

 

Unattended Robotics
UiPath enables autonomous automation: robots-managing-robots. They are capable of monitoring and handling attended & unattended robot collaboration and optimizingend-to-end workflow automation with centralized work queues. AI robotic managers reduce automation costs & meet service levels by synchronizing queued work and robot deployments with scheduled workflows and events; monitoring & triggering failover procedures, as needed. Orchestrate all of this from cloud or on-premises.

 

Computer Vision
UiPath is the only RPA tool that applies AI in the Computer/Machine Vision field - solving a wide variety of problems. Our robots have intelligent eyes to “see” screen elements using contextual relationships - just as humans do, bringing unrivaled accuracy and precision to automation. Other robots, blind by comparison to ours, are limited to locating screen elements with various methods e.g. configured searches or coordinates. UiPath Robots give two very significant advantages: implementations are 2-4 times faster and production is much more stable because computer vision instantly accounts for any screen changes that might occur while processes are running. Our computer vision advantages are multiplied in Citrix environments, a large part of RPA automation solutions with ERP systems in scope. In Citrix, our implementation speeds are 20x faster than those of providers using blind robots.

 

Cognitive enhancements
With language detection, the extraction of unstructured data, and sentiment analysis, UiPath Robots extend the scope of automation to knowledge-based processes that otherwise couldn’tbe covered. They not only handle the automation of unstructured content (think irregular paper invoices) but can interpret content and apply rules ( unhappy social media posts). Language detection is a prerequisite for precision in OCR image analysis, and sentiment analysis helps the Robots understand the meaning and emotion of text language and use it as the basis for complex decision making. High value solutions range from insurance to accounting to customer service & more.

Multi-Cloud Technology and Business Insights
 

 

Where is Hybrid Heading? Views on exploiting multi-modal IT
Hybrid IT ecosystems – combining traditional, cloud-hosted, born-in-the-cloud, and IoT systems delivered from the network edge – are becoming more critical and interconnected for most enterprises. However, whilst Multi-Cloud is critical to embracing the pace of change needed to survive in today’s business environment, more and more organizations are concerned at the complexity of managing multiple cloud infrastructures, and by the tight interconnections needed at an application level. This study is intended to provide invaluable guidance to help organizations succeed with their Multi-Cloud enabled Hybrid IT plans. It also aims to fully arm them with the lessons learnt by peers who have achieved successful implementations – like the 34% of enterprises that have transformed their applications at the same time as moving them to the cloud.

 

 

Co-creation is crucial for cloud success
The cloud is enabling organisations to build new services that transform the user experience and increase customer engagement. With the cloud, any business can now access enterprise-class services and capabilities, as well as advanced development tools, enabling innovation at great speed. The most successful transformations are enabled through co-creation, powered by an ecosystem of partners working together with customers. (From the "Cloud for Business" report published by Raconteur in The Times on 11th December, 2018.)
